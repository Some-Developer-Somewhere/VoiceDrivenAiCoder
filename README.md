# VoiceDrivenAiCoder

Voice-Driven Code Generation and Editing Tool (ChatGPT/GPT/LLM based)

## Status

This tool is just hastily thrown together, so it should not be used as a base for further development.

I will recomend to use
I'd rather recommend to use this repo only for inspiration and just look at the relevant files for the functionality you want to achieve. Then rewrite that code to fit in your project. 

Please look in the file 'other_repos.md' for more comprehensive and well-written projects which use GPT for AI code development.

## Setup

### Add secret to env vars (windows)

> setx SECRET_OPENAI_API_KEY your_secret_key_here
> setx SECRET_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY your_secret_key_here

Note: setx required restart of the computer in my case.
